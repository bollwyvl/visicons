# visicons
> nice icons for showing data about data

So you're building a visualization builder, and want your user
- to be able to create linked scales in two axes
- hover over a part of your visualization and find out what type of thing it is


`visicons` gives you a `font-face` for icons for creating and describing
visualizations, so can use them in buttons, menus, mouseovers, or even in-line
with text.

## Use
> TODO: publish
```shell
npm install visicons
# or
bower install visicons
```

To request a new icon, create a pull request that adds the new icon
to the [Roadmap](#Icon Roadmap) above. It will probably be merged!

To propose a new icon, create a pull request that implements one of the
missing roadmap icons. New icons are assigned a Unicode code point, like
`uEA01` so that the ordering is consistent across versions: code points will be
handed out in the order they are requested.
